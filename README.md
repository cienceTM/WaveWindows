# Wave

This repository contains the source code for the user interface of the popular Roblox exploit, [Wave](https://getwave.gg). I have made modifications to the code, allowing any username and password combination to grant access to the main window. Additionally, I have disabled the Tab system as it was causing crashes on my end, although other users have reported no issues with it. You are welcome to re-enable the Tab system if it works for you.

If the Wave development team requests the removal of this modified code, please contact me, and I will take it down promptly. Thank you.
